## Control navigation with UI elements

* TODO:
Currently, your application supports two routes.
However, the only way to use those routes is for the user to manually type the path in the browser's address bar.
In this section, you'll add two links that users can click to navigate between the `heroes-list` and `crisis-list` components.
You'll also add some CSS styles.
While these styles are not required, they make it easier to identify the link for the currently-displayed component.
You'll add that functionality in the next section.

1. Open the `app.component.html` file and add the following HTML below the title.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="nav"/>

    This HTML uses an Angular directive, `routerLink`.
    This directive connects the routes you defined to your template files.

1. Add the `RouterLink` directive to the imports list of `AppComponent` in `app.component.ts`.

1. Open the `app.component.css` file and add the following styles.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.css" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.css"/>

If you view your application in the browser, you should see these two links.
When you click on a link, the corresponding component appears.

## Identify the active route

While users can navigate your application using the links you added in the previous section, they don't have a straightforward way to identify what the active route is.
Add this functionality using Angular's `routerLinkActive` directive.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.component.html` file.
1. Update the anchor tags to include the `routerLinkActive` directive.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="routeractivelink"/>
1. Add the `RouterLinkActive` directive to the `imports` list of `AppComponent` in `app.component.ts`.

View your application again.
As you click one of the buttons, the style for that button updates automatically, identifying the active component to the user.
By adding the `routerLinkActive` directive, you inform your application to apply a specific CSS class to the active route.
In this tutorial, that CSS class is `activebutton`, but you could use any class that you want.

Note that we are also specifying a value for the `routerLinkActive`'s `ariaCurrentWhenActive`. This makes sure that visually impaired users (which may not perceive the different styling being applied) can also identify the active button. For more information see the Accessibility Best Practices [Active links identification section](/best-practices/a11y#active-links-identification).

## Adding a redirect

In this step of the tutorial, you add a route that redirects the user to display the `/heroes-list` component.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.routes.ts` file.
1. Update the `routes` section as follows.

    ```ts
    {path: '', redirectTo: '/heroes-list', pathMatch: 'full'},
    ```

    Notice that this new route uses an empty string as its path.
    In addition, it replaces the `component` property with two new ones:

    | Properties   | Details |
    |:---        |:---    |
    | `redirectTo` | This property instructs Angular to redirect from an empty path to the `heroes-list` path.                                                                                                                                                       |
    | `pathMatch`  | This property instructs Angular on how much of the URL to match. For this tutorial, you should set this property to `full`. This strategy is recommended when you have an empty string for a path. For more information about this property, see the [Route API documentation](api/router/Route). |

Now when you open your application, it displays the `heroes-list` component by default.

## Adding a 404 page

It is possible for a user to try to access a route that you have not defined.
To account for this behavior, the best practice is to display a 404 page.
In this section, you'll create a 404 page and update your route configuration to show that page for any unspecified routes.

1. From the terminal, create a new component, `PageNotFound`.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng generate component page-not-found
    </docs-code>

1. From your code editor, open the `page-not-found.component.html` file and replace its contents with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/page-not-found/page-not-found.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/page-not-found/page-not-found.component.html"/>

1. Open the `app.routes.ts` file and add the following route to the routes list:

    ```ts
    {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
    ```

    The new route uses a path, `**`.
    This path is how Angular identifies a wildcard route.
    Any route that does not match an existing route in your configuration will use this route.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the wildcard route is placed at the end of the array.
The order of your routes is important, as Angular applies routes in order and uses the first match it finds.

Try navigating to a non-existing route on your application, such as `http://localhost:4200/powers`.
This route doesn't match anything defined in your `app.routes.ts` file.
However, because you defined a wildcard route, the application automatically displays your `PageNotFound` component.

## Next steps

At this point, you have a basic application that uses Angular's routing feature to change what components the user can see based on the URL address.
You have extended these features to include a redirect, as well as a wildcard route to display a custom 404 page.
