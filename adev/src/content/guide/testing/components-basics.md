# Basics of testing components

* test a component approaches
  * [Component DOM testing](#component-dom-testing)
    * == ðŸ’¡test template + TypeScript class work TOGETHER as intendedðŸ’¡
      * == 
        * component state displays properly | appropriate times,
        * simulate user interaction / affect to the component
    * ðŸ‘€MORE precise one ðŸ‘€
  * test ONLY TypeScript class
    * == NO DOM involved == out of the scope
      * component rendering 
      * -- respond to -- user input and gestures
      * -- integrate with -- its parent and child components

* _Example:_ [source code](../../examples/testing/componentsBasics)

## Component DOM testing

* requirements
  * create the component's host element | browser DOM
    * == Angular does
    * == DOM elements -- associated with the -- components 
  * test component class's interaction -- with the -- DOM
* ðŸ’¡-- via -- `TestBed` + OTHER testing helpersðŸ’¡

### CLI-generated tests

* `ng generate component componentName` 
  * -> ðŸ’¡creates an INITIAL test file ðŸ’¡

* `TestBed.compileComponents`
  * asynchronous -- thanks to -- wrapped it by 
    * | old versions,
      * -- via -- [`@angular/core/testing` `waitForAsync`](api/core/testing/waitForAsync)
    * | NEW versions,
      * `async` JS

### Reduce the setup

* TODO:
Only the last three lines of this file actually test the component and all they do is assert that Angular can create the component.

The rest of the file is boilerplate setup code anticipating more advanced tests that *might* become necessary if the component evolves into something substantial.

You'll learn about these advanced test features in the following sections.
For now, you can radically reduce this test file to a more manageable size:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts (minimal)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v2"/>

In this example, the metadata object passed to `TestBed.configureTestingModule` simply declares `BannerComponent`, the component to test.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="configureTestingModule"/>

HELPFUL: There's no need to declare or import anything else.
The default test module is pre-configured with something like the `BrowserModule` from `@angular/platform-browser`.

Later you'll call `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` with imports, providers, and more declarations to suit your testing needs.
Optional `override` methods can further fine-tune aspects of the configuration.

### `createComponent()`

After configuring `TestBed`, you call its `createComponent()` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="createComponent"/>

`TestBed.createComponent()` creates an instance of the `BannerComponent`, adds a corresponding element to the test-runner DOM, and returns a [`ComponentFixture`](#componentfixture).

IMPORTANT: Do not re-configure `TestBed` after calling `createComponent`.

The `createComponent` method freezes the current `TestBed` definition, closing it to further configuration.

You cannot call any more `TestBed` configuration methods, not `configureTestingModule()`, nor `get()`, nor any of the `override...` methods.
If you try, `TestBed` throws an error.

### `ComponentFixture`

The [ComponentFixture](api/core/testing/ComponentFixture) is a test harness for interacting with the created component and its corresponding element.

Access the component instance through the fixture and confirm it exists with a Jasmine expectation:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="componentInstance"/>

### `beforeEach()`

You will add more tests as this component evolves.
Rather than duplicate the `TestBed` configuration for each test, you refactor to pull the setup into a Jasmine `beforeEach()` and some supporting variables:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v3"/>

Now add a test that gets the component's element from `fixture.nativeElement` and looks for the expected text.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-2"/>

### `nativeElement`

The value of `ComponentFixture.nativeElement` has the `any` type.
Later you'll encounter the `DebugElement.nativeElement` and it too has the `any` type.

Angular can't know at compile time what kind of HTML element the `nativeElement` is or if it even is an HTML element.
The application might be running on a *non-browser platform*, such as the server or a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), where the element might have a diminished API or not exist at all.

The tests in this guide are designed to run in a browser so a `nativeElement` value will always be an `HTMLElement` or one of its derived classes.

Knowing that it is an `HTMLElement` of some sort, use the standard HTML `querySelector` to dive deeper into the element tree.

Here's another test that calls `HTMLElement.querySelector` to get the paragraph element and look for the banner text:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-3"/>

### `DebugElement`

The Angular *fixture* provides the component's element directly through the `fixture.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="nativeElement"/>

This is actually a convenience method, implemented as `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="debugElement-nativeElement"/>

There's a good reason for this circuitous path to the element.

The properties of the `nativeElement` depend upon the runtime environment.
You could be running these tests on a *non-browser* platform that doesn't have a DOM or whose DOM-emulation doesn't support the full `HTMLElement` API.

Angular relies on the `DebugElement` abstraction to work safely across *all supported platforms*.
Instead of creating an HTML element tree, Angular creates a `DebugElement` tree that wraps the *native elements* for the runtime platform.
The `nativeElement` property unwraps the `DebugElement` and returns the platform-specific element object.

Because the sample tests for this guide are designed to run only in a browser, a `nativeElement` in these tests is always an `HTMLElement` whose familiar methods and properties you can explore within a test.

Here's the previous test, re-implemented with `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-4"/>

The `DebugElement` has other methods and properties that are useful in tests, as you'll see elsewhere in this guide.

You import the `DebugElement` symbol from the Angular core library.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-debug-element"/>

### `By.css()`

Although the tests in this guide all run in the browser, some applications might run on a different platform at least some of the time.

For example, the component might render first on the server as part of a strategy to make the application launch faster on poorly connected devices.
The server-side renderer might not support the full HTML element API.
If it doesn't support `querySelector`, the previous test could fail.

The `DebugElement` offers query methods that work for all supported platforms.
These query methods take a *predicate* function that returns `true` when a node in the `DebugElement` tree matches the selection criteria.

You create a *predicate* with the help of a `By` class imported from a library for the runtime platform.
Here's the `By` import for the browser platform:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-by"/>

The following example re-implements the previous test with `DebugElement.query()` and the browser's `By.css` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-5"/>

Some noteworthy observations:

* The `By.css()` static method selects `DebugElement` nodes with a [standard CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors 'CSS selectors').
* The query returns a `DebugElement` for the paragraph.
* You must unwrap that result to get the paragraph element.

When you're filtering by CSS selector and only testing properties of a browser's *native element*, the `By.css` approach might be overkill.

It's often more straightforward and clear to filter with a standard `HTMLElement` method such as `querySelector()` or `querySelectorAll()`.
