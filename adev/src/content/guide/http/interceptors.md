* TODO: 
<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  console.log(req.url);
  return next(req);       // NEXT step | interceptor chain
}
</docs-code>

* configure `HttpClient`

### Configuring interceptors

You declare the set of interceptors to use when configuring `HttpClient` through dependency injection, by using the `withInterceptors` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    withInterceptors([loggingInterceptor, cachingInterceptor]),
  )
]});
</docs-code>

The interceptors you configure are chained together in the order that you've listed them in the providers. In the above example, the `loggingInterceptor` would process the request and then forward it to the `cachingInterceptor`.

### Intercepting response events

An interceptor may transform the `Observable` stream of `HttpEvent`s returned by `next` in order to access or manipulate the response. Because this stream includes all response events, inspecting the `.type` of each event may be necessary in order to identify the final response object.

<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  return next(req).pipe(tap(event => {
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.Response) {
      console.log(req.url, 'returned a response with status', event.status);
    }
  }));
}
</docs-code>

Tip: Interceptors naturally associate responses with their outgoing requests, because they transform the response stream in a closure that captures the request object.

## Modifying requests

Most aspects of `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` instances are _immutable_, and interceptors cannot directly modify them. Instead, interceptors apply mutations by cloning these objects using the `.clone()` operation, and specifying which properties should be mutated in the new instance. This might involve performing immutable updates on the value itself (like `HttpHeaders` or `HttpParams`).

For example, to add a header to a request:

<docs-code language="ts">
const reqWithHeader = req.clone({
  headers: req.headers.set('X-New-Header', 'new header value'),
});
</docs-code>

This immutability allows most interceptors to be idempotent if the same `HttpRequest` is submitted to the interceptor chain multiple times. This can happen for a few reasons, including when a request is retried after failure.

CRITICAL: The body of a request or response is **not** protected from deep mutations. If an interceptor must mutate the body, take care to handle running multiple times on the same request.

## Dependency injection in interceptors

Interceptors are run in the _injection context_ of the injector which registered them, and can use  Angular's `inject` API to retrieve dependencies.

For example, suppose an application has a service called `AuthService`, which creates authentication tokens for outgoing requests. An interceptor can inject and use this service:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function authInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn) {
  // Inject the current `AuthService` and use it to get an authentication token:
  const authToken = inject(AuthService).getAuthToken();

  // Clone the request to add the authentication header.
  const newReq = req.clone({
    headers: req.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', authToken),
  });
  return next(newReq);
}
</docs-code>

## Request and response metadata

Often it's useful to include information in a request that's not sent to the backend, but is specifically meant for interceptors. `HttpRequest`s have a `.context` object which stores this kind of metadata as an instance of `HttpContext`. This object functions as a typed map, with keys of type `HttpContextToken`.

To illustrate how this system works, let's use metadata to control whether a caching interceptor is enabled for a given request.

### Defining context tokens

To store whether the caching interceptor should cache a particular request in that request's `.context` map, define a new `HttpContextToken` to act as a key:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const CACHING_ENABLED = new HttpContextToken<boolean>(() => true);
</docs-code>

The provided function creates the default value for the token for requests that haven't explicitly set a value for it. Using a function ensures that if the token's value is an object or array, each request gets its own instance.

### Reading the token in an interceptor

An interceptor can then read the token and choose to apply caching logic or not based on its value:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function cachingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  if (req.context.get(CACHING_ENABLED)) {
    // apply caching logic
    return ...;
  } else {
    // caching has been disabled for this request
    return next(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

### Setting context tokens when making a request

When making a request via the `HttpClient` API, you can provide values for `HttpContextToken`s:

<docs-code language="ts">
const data$ = http.get('/sensitive/data', {
  context: new HttpContext().set(CACHING_ENABLED, false),
});
</docs-code>

Interceptors can read these values from the `HttpContext` of the request.

### The request context is mutable

Unlike other properties of `HttpRequest`s, the associated `HttpContext` is _mutable_. If an interceptor changes the context of a request that is later retried, the same interceptor will observe the context mutation when it runs again. This is useful for passing state across multiple retries if needed.

## Synthetic responses

Most interceptors will simply invoke the `next` handler while transforming either the request or the response, but this is not strictly a requirement. This section discusses several of the ways in which an interceptor may incorporate more advanced behavior.

Interceptors are not required to invoke `next`. They may instead choose to construct responses through some other mechanism, such as from a cache or by sending the request through an alternate mechanism.

Constructing a response is possible using the `HttpResponse` constructor:

<docs-code language="ts">
const resp = new HttpResponse({
  body: 'response body',
});
</docs-code>

## DI-based interceptors

`HttpClient` also supports interceptors which are defined as injectable classes and configured through the DI system. The capabilities of DI-based interceptors are identical to those of functional interceptors, but the configuration mechanism is different.

A DI-based interceptor is an injectable class which implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, handler: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log('Request URL: ' + req.url);
    return handler.handle(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors are configured through a dependency injection multi-provider:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    // DI-based interceptors must be explicitly enabled.
    withInterceptorsFromDi(),
  ),

  {provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: LoggingInterceptor, multi: true},
]});
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors run in the order that their providers are registered. In an app with an extensive and hierarchical DI configuration, this order can be very hard to predict.
