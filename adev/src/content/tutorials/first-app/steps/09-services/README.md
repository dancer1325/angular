  * allows
    * serving data | your app / separated -- from -- Angular's components
  * ðŸ‘€if you want to use it | MULTIPLE components -> make it injectable ðŸ‘€
    * == component's dependency

* Dependency injection
  * == mechanism / manages the 
    * dependencies of an app's components
    * services / OTHER components can use

* steps
  * `ng generate service housing --skip-tests`
  * | HousingService,
    * paste `HomeComponent`'s properties
    * create functions / return those properties
  * | HomeComponent
    * inject the NEW service
    * get the list of items -- invoking a -- service's method
